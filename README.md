# Browse InfoSeeking studies in PubMed

Browse 'information needs-seeking-use' studies in PubMed with Python-generated report

Task: Let's say you are creating a new web resource for a particular 
audience, such as "caregivers." What do you know about the information
needs, information seeking, and information use behaviors of this audience? 
The more you know, the more effective your communication will be. Much as 
been published.

Subject matter experts, product managers, public affairs staff, etc. in
medicine- and health-related disciplines could use an ongoing connection to
this type of research.

Through this basic Python script, the Persons branch of the Medical Subject 
Headings (MeSH) tree, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009272, becomes a
useful tool for accessing this research by individual audience types. It
provides a standing count of studies for each named audience, that you can
retrieve from pubmed.gov.

Information introducing the script describes mechanisms, requirements, and 
a few caveats.

Run this bibliometric report periodically so you and your staff can have an uncomplicated
foothold into this type of research.
