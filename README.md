# Browse InfoSeeking studies in PubMed

Browse 'information needs-seeking-use' studies in PubMed with Python-generated report

Task: Let's say you are creating a new web resource for a particular 
audience, such as "caregivers." What do you know about the information
needs, information seeking, and information use behaviors of this audience? 
Much as been published.

Subject matter experts, product managers, public affairs staff, etc. in
medicine- and health-related disciplines could use an ongoing connection to
this type of research.

Through this basic Python script, the Persons branch of the Medical Subject 
Headings (MeSH) tree, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009272, becomes a
useful tool for accessing this research by individual audience types. It
provides a standing count of studies for each named audience, that you can
retrieve from pubmed.gov.

Information at the script describes mechanisms and a few caveats.

Run this report periodically to maintain a starting point for people looking
for this type of research.
